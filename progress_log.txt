1st checkpoint (10.3.2020)

- Created the project and all the classes so far.
- Class Piece methods rotate and flip have been implemented not tested yet.
- Methods for adding and removing pieces form the pile and the board have also been implemented.
- Implemented a private method in class 'Pile' for randomly selecting a symbol.
- Time spent approximately: 5-10 hours


2nd checkpoint (24.3.2020)

- I've Finished implementing most methods in the main classes. I have only tested them very little. 
- Started working on the GUI. I haven't really made a lot of progress with that because it's been slightly hard
  to find information on it. 
- I have also tried to start working on the class for file operations such as saving the game state into a file 
  but haven't really made any progress with that either. 
- I had some trouble with testing but got it to work out in the end.  
- Time spent approximately: 10-15 hours
