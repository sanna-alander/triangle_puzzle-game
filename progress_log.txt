2nd checkpoint (24.3.2020)

hours IIIIIIII

- Finished implementing most methods in the main classes. I unfortunately haven't been able to test any of them yet. 
- Started working on the GUI. I haven't really made a lot of progress with that because it's been slightly hard
  to find information on it. 
- 
- I've also had some trouble with testing. I don't really know how to test my methods.
